# Encapsulation




## BankAccount Encapsulation Example

This project demonstrates the concept of encapsulation in Java using a simple BankAccount class. It shows how private fields are protected and accessed through methods instead of directly.

### Features

1) Stores account number, account holder name, and balance

2) Validates balance to prevent negative values

3) Getter methods for accessing private data

### Code Overview

- Private fields for safety

- Setter methods to update values

- Getter methods to access values

The Encapsulation class creates several BankAccount objects and prints information using getter methods.

### How to Run
